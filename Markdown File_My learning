Getting comfortable with feeling uncomfortable

<p> While navigating the complex world of Github, git and VS Code, I have come to embrace this very statment as a non speciaist. 
Essentially, feel the fear, frustration and face it head on. I'm told, quite eloquently and frequenty, that it gets better! </p>

Google everything

<p> As I complete this project, I understand I may have made some beginner's mistakes. I embrace it. In the same vein, I fall back on the advice to google advice, in a 
succinct manner in order to reduce negative mindset linked with aspects of this course. Rome was certainly not built in a day, and even with years of experinece, 
seasoned developed say when in doubt for longer than 15 minutes, "Google." </p>
